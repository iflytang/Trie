In computer science, a trie, also called digital tree and sometimes radix tree or prefix tree (as they can be searched by prefixes), is a kind of search treeâ€”an ordered tree data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings.

If we have words such as apps, apply, apple, append, back, basic, backen. Then we will get graph as follows. The orange color represents the end of one word.
